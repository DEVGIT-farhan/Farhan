        <h2>Me at a glance.</h2>
        <p>I'm an aspiring designer/developer and a CA aspirant always working to build new skills and hone my existing ones. I enjoy not only the work, but the results as well, ranging from the satifaction of seeing the finished product all the way to the satisfaction of knowing my work is ultimately helping someone somewhere. I'm at my starting stage of programing I look forward to gain more skills.</p>
        <p>I've come to experience work in a great many fields in Business and finance including Auditing, Taxation, Financial and General Management just to name a few. I have taken quite easily to all the work I've done over the years and as well have enjoyed it, but nothing feels quite like this does. This I enjoy passsionately and hope to grow that passion into a career I can enjoy and love.</p>
